# Future Work Ideas

## Dynamic Insight Harvesting System

**Vision**: Tag text, conversations, media with tags that include content in an index or bump it up in a vector store to harvest learnings frequently and automatically - "growing insights by the heat of friction between our psyches and problems."

### Core Concept
- **Knowledge garden** where insights naturally accumulate and cross-pollinate
- **Automatic tagging** of friction points, solutions, and process improvements
- **Vector store with "hot spots"** around recurring patterns
- **Just-in-time insight retrieval** - surface relevant learnings when needed

### MCP Tool Ideas
- `capture_insight(text, tags, context)` - Tag and store insights with metadata
- `search_insights(query)` - Semantic search through captured knowledge  
- `get_relevant_insights(current_context)` - Auto-suggest related learnings
- `get_insight_clusters()` - Identify patterns in captured knowledge

### Technical Approach
- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity
- Tagging system for categorical organization
- Automatic context detection for relevance scoring
- Integration with conversation flow for seamless capture

### Benefits
- **Compound learning** - each session builds on previous insights
- **Pattern recognition** - identify recurring collaboration friction
- **Process evolution** - systematic improvement of working methods
- **Collective memory** - preserve and build on discoveries

### Implementation Priority
- Start with simple tagging and storage
- Add semantic search capabilities
- Build auto-suggestion features
- Integrate with conversation context
